# Airbnb Listings in Berlin

## Overview
This repository contains some examples of Python scripts that I used to analyse the apartment and room features of Airbnb listings in Berlin.

## Objective
Identify features of a house or apartment that customers find important, and help homeowners to maximize the value of their properties.

Key questions to be answered:
1. How many listings are there in Berlin?
2. What kind of properties are  listed? 
3. Where are the listed properties and where are the popular areas?
4. What features of the apartment are important for the travelers? 
5. What price can one ask for hie or her apartment or room?

## Data
The data sets contain 2 files; [Inside Airbnb](https://insideairbnb.com/berlin) downloaded from Airbnb, and [Airbnb Prices in European Cities](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/airbnb-prices-in-european-cities) downloaded via kaggle. Inside Airbnb contains information like location, type of property, price, restaurant index, attraction index, rating score and owner ID. Whereas Airban Prices in European Cities contains infomation such as distance from city center, distance from metro station, and guest satisfaction.  					

## Tools
The analysis was conducted using Python with the following libraries:
+ Matplotlib: creating charts e.g. bar, pie, line, histogram and scatterplot
+ Numpy: performing mathematical operations on arrays
+ Pandas: organizing data into rows and columns making it easy to clean, analyze, and manipulate data
+ Seaborn: creating charts e.g. bar, pie, line, histogram and scatterplot
+ SciPy: broader spectrum of scientific tools, algorithms, and functions
